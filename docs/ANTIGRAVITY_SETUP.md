# Antigravity Setup Guide

Track your Antigravity AI model quota usage with onWatch.

---

## What is Antigravity?

[Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) is an AI coding assistant that provides access to multiple AI models including Claude, Gemini, and GPT variants. onWatch can monitor your model quotas by connecting to the locally running Antigravity language server process.

---

## Prerequisites

- Antigravity installed and running
- onWatch installed ([Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start))

---

## How It Works

onWatch automatically detects the Antigravity language server running on your machine by:

1. Scanning for the `antigravity` process
2. Extracting the CSRF token and port from command-line arguments
3. Connecting via the Connect RPC protocol
4. Polling the `/exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/GetUserStatus` endpoint

No manual configuration is required for local development.

## Data Sources: IDE vs CLI (agy)

Antigravity ships in more than one form, and **all variants share a single
Google-account quota**, so onWatch shows one Antigravity card and lets you choose
where the data comes from:

| Source | What it does | Data richness |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| `ide` | Probes the running Antigravity **desktop/IDE** language server. | Per-model session quotas. |
| `cli` | Launches and manages the **`agy` CLI** in a pseudo-terminal and reads its `RetrieveUserQuotaSummary` endpoint. | Richer: weekly **and** 5-hour limits for the Gemini and Claude+GPT groups. |
| `both` (default) | Prefers the `agy` CLI for its richer data and falls back to the IDE probe when `agy` is unavailable. | Best available. |

The dashboard card shows a **"Source: agy CLI / IDE"** badge indicating which
probe produced the data you're seeing.

### Choosing a source

- **During setup:** `onwatch setup` asks which source to use when you enable Antigravity.
- **Anytime in the dashboard:** open Settings -> Providers -> Antigravity and pick a Data Source. The change takes effect on the next poll - no restart needed.
- **Via environment:** set `ANTIGRAVITY_SOURCE=both|cli|ide` in your `.env`.

### About the `agy` CLI source

The `agy` CLI only exposes its quota server while an interactive process is
alive, and it exits immediately without a terminal. To read it, onWatch launches
a managed `agy` process inside a pseudo-terminal, keeps it warm between polls,
relaunches it if it becomes unhealthy, tears it down when idle or on shutdown,
and **only ever stops the process it started** - your own interactive `agy`
sessions are never touched.

onWatch locates `agy` via `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_PATH`, then your `PATH`, then common
install locations (`~/.local/bin/agy`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/agy`,
`/usr/local/bin/agy`). The CLI source is supported on macOS, Linux, and Windows
(via ConPTY); the Unix path is the most thoroughly validated.

## Quick Start (Auto-Detection)

### Step 1: Enable Antigravity in onWatch

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
cd ~/.onwatch
```

Edit `.env` and add:

```
ANTIGRAVITY_ENABLED=true
```

Or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export ANTIGRAVITY_ENABLED=true
```

### Step 2: Restart onWatch

```bash
onwatch stop
onwatch
```

Or in debug mode to verify:

```bash
onwatch --debug
```

You should see:

```
Antigravity auto-detection enabled (process scanning mode)
Starting Antigravity agent (interval: 60s)
connected to Antigravity language server port=63516 protocol=https
```

### Step 3: View Dashboard

Open http://localhost:9211 and click the **antigravity** tab.

You'll see quota cards for each model, including:
- Claude Sonnet
- Gemini Pro
- GPT-4 variants
- And other available models

## Docker/Container Configuration

In containerized environments where process scanning doesn't work, you can manually configure the connection:

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ANTIGRAVITY_ENABLED` | Enable Antigravity provider | `true` |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the language server | `https://127.0.0.1:42100` |
| `ANTIGRAVITY_CSRF_TOKEN` | CSRF token from the process | `your_csrf_token_here` |

### Example Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  onwatch:
    image: ghcr.io/onllm-dev/onwatch:latest
    environment:
      - ANTIGRAVITY_ENABLED=true
      - ANTIGRAVITY_BASE_URL=https://host.docker.internal:42100
      - ANTIGRAVITY_CSRF_TOKEN=your_csrf_token
    ports:
      - "9211:9211"
```

### Finding the Port and Token

On the host machine, find the running Antigravity process:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
ps aux | grep antigravity | grep -E "csrf_token|extension_server_port"

# Example output:
# /path/to/antigravity --csrf_token=abc123 --extension_server_port=42100
```

Extract the values:
- `--extension_server_port=42100` - Use as the port in `ANTIGRAVITY_BASE_URL`
- `--csrf_token=abc123` - Use as `ANTIGRAVITY_CSRF_TOKEN`

---

## What Gets Tracked

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Model Quotas | Per-model remaining fraction (0.0 to 1.0) |
| Reset Times | When each model's quota resets |
| Prompt Credits | Available credits for your plan |
| Plan Info | Your subscription tier (Free, Pro, etc.) |

The dashboard shows:
- Usage percentage for each AI model
- Remaining quota with color indicators
- Reset countdown timers
- Usage history and projections

---

## Supported Models

onWatch tracks all models available in your Antigravity subscription:

| Model ID | Display Name |
|----------|--------------|
| `claude-4-5-sonnet` | Claude 4.5 Sonnet |
| `claude-4-5-sonnet-thinking` | Claude 4.5 Sonnet (Thinking) |
| `gemini-3-pro` | Gemini 3 Pro |
| `gemini-3-flash` | Gemini 3 Flash |
| (others) | Automatically detected |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Antigravity agent not starting"

1. Verify Antigravity is running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep antigravity
   ```

2. Check if the process has the required arguments:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep antigravity | grep csrf_token
   ```

3. Ensure `ANTIGRAVITY_ENABLED=true` is set

### "No models showing"

- Make sure you're logged into Antigravity
- Check that your subscription is active
- Run onWatch in debug mode: `onwatch --debug`

### "Connection refused"

The language server might be using a self-signed certificate. onWatch handles this automatically, but if you're using manual configuration:

- Ensure the port is correct
- Try both `https://` and `http://` protocols
- Check firewall settings

### "CSRF token invalid"

The token changes when Antigravity restarts. For auto-detection mode, restart onWatch after restarting Antigravity:

```bash
onwatch stop && onwatch
```

For manual configuration, update `ANTIGRAVITY_CSRF_TOKEN` with the new value.

---

## API Details

onWatch uses the Connect RPC protocol to communicate with the Antigravity language server:

**Endpoint:**
```
POST /exa.language_server_pb.LanguageServerService/GetUserStatus
```

**Headers:**
```
Content-Type: application/json
Connect-Protocol-Version: 1
X-Codeium-Csrf-Token: <token>
```

**Response structure:**
```json
{
  "userStatus": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "planStatus": {
      "availablePromptCredits": 500,
      "planInfo": {
        "planName": "Pro",
        "monthlyPromptCredits": 1000
      }
    },
    "cascadeModelConfigData": {
      "clientModelConfigs": [
        {
          "label": "Claude Sonnet",
          "modelOrAlias": {"model": "claude-4-5-sonnet"},
          "quotaInfo": {
            "remainingFraction": 0.75,
            "resetTime": "2026-02-24T12:00:00Z"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Notes

- onWatch connects only to localhost (or your configured URL)
- The CSRF token is never sent to external servers
- All data stays on your machine (SQLite database)
- Auto-detection only reads process arguments, not memory
